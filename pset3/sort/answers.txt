sort1 uses: bubble

How do you know?: On sorted lists bubble (Ω(n)) and merge (Ω(nlogn)) are really close. On unsorted lists bubble (O(n^2)) is much worse than merge (O(nlogn)).

sort2 uses: merge

How do you know?: On sorted lists bubble (Ω(n)) and merge (Ω(nlogn)) are really close. Merge sort is much faster on unsorted or reversed lists because its upper bound is O(nlogn) instead of O(n^2).

sort3 uses: selection

How do you know?: Selection sort is much slower on sorted lists because its lower bound is Ω(n^2); not Ω(n) or Ω(nlogn).
